React Theme Switcher – Technical Implementation (Short Guide)
Core Logic
Theme State Management
``` bash
const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
```

Manages the current theme (light/dark) in React state.
Theme Toggle Function
```bash
const toggleTheme = () => {
  setTheme(prev => prev === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
};
```

Switches between light and dark themes on button click.
Applying Theme Classes
```bash
<div className={`App ${theme}`}>
  {/* ... */}
</div>
```

Adds the current theme as a class to the root element for CSS styling.
CSS Structure
Theme Classes
```bash
.light { background: #fff; color: #333; }
.dark { background: #333; color: #fff; }
```

Defines color schemes for each theme.
Smooth Transitions
```bash
.App { transition: all 0.3s ease; }
```

Enables smooth color changes when switching themes.
Components
App Component Holds theme state and provides layout.
Top Bar Displays navigation and theme toggle button.
Theme Toggle Button Calls toggleTheme to switch themes.
Best Practices
Use semantic class names for themes.
Keep components focused and modular.
Use CSS transitions for smooth UX.
Future Enhancements
Persist Theme
```bash
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
}, [theme]);
```

Saves selected theme to local storage.
System Theme Detection
```bash
const prefersDark = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');
```

Detects user’s OS-level theme preference.
Summary:
This implementation uses React state for theme management, toggles themes with a button, and applies theme classes for CSS-based styling and transitions. Components are modular, and the setup is ready for enhancements like theme persistence and system preference detection.
